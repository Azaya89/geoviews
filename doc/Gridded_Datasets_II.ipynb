To use it, you supply the Element type that you want to view the data as and the key dimensions of that view and it will figure out the rest. Depending on the type of Element, you can specify one or more dimensions to be displayed. This means that only certain Elements allow you to display the data on a cartographic projection. Recall that the cube we are working with has 4 coordinate dimensions (or key dimensions as they are known in HoloViews) -- time, realization, longitude and latitude. \n",
